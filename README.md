# tensorflow-template
A standard Tensorflow project template that can be copied and modified for
new projects.

The example problem solves a softmax regression where the
independent variables are only known up to a multivariate normal distributions.
See the 'latex/doc.pdf' for details on the mathematics.

The aim is to closely follow the best practices as set out
[here](https://blog.metaflow.fr/tensorflow-a-proposal-of-good-practices-for-files-folders-and-models-architecture-f23171501ae3).
